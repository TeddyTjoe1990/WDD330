        <h2>Week 10 Notes: Validating forms | Using Fetch</h2>

    <main>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>Validating Forms</h2>
            </li>
            <p>Form validation is something you find on most websites where you either sign up for or create an account for. You will need to provide things such as emails or passwords. Form validation makes sure that the user inputs the right things in
                the right places. For example, if you are entering your email, you will always have a <i>@</i> and <i>.com</i> in the email.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is an input box that will ask you for an email. Try entering something that is not an email. There's also a password with some requirements to meet. Try different things and hit <i>submit</i> to see what happens.
            </p>
            <form>
                <label for="email">Email:</label>
                <input id="email" type="email" name="email" placeholder="your email" required="email">
                <label for="Password">Password:</label>
                <input id="Password" type="password" name="Password" placeholder="your password" required="Password" pattern=".{5,10}" required title="5-10 Characters">
                <input type="submit" name="submit">
            </form>
            <p>
                HTML5 provides built-in form validation. That way, there's no need to use any Javascript in order to validate a form, at least for some things. You can include attributes on form elements in your HTML to use validation. Some attributes are <i>required, minlength</i>                and <i>maxlength, min</i> and <i>max, type</i> and <i>pattern.</i>
            </p>

                <h2>Using Fetch</h2>
            </li>
            <p>Fetch usage is usually synonymous with API. <i><u>Fetch</u></i> itself if translated literally means <i><u>to take</u></i>. In this case, we are talking web design, the use of Fetch is usually always connected to the API. The Fetch API allows
                us to asynchronously request for a resource. Use the fetch() method to return a promise that resolves into a Response object. To get the actual data, you call one of the methods of the Response object e.g., text() or json() . These methods
                resolve into the actual data. </p>
            <p>Syntax:
                <p>// API for get requests<br/>let fetchRes = fetch(<br/>"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1");<br/>// fetchRes is the promise to resolve<br/>// it by using.then() method<br/>fetchRes.then(res =><br/>-----res.json()).then(d => {<br/>---------console.log(d)<br/>-----})</p>
            </p>
