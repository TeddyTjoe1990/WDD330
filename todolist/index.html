    <!-- Over the next 2 weeks we will practice what we have learned so far by building a 
        small web application. For this first challenge we will all build a simple To Do tracking application.

        Review the details in the simple design document below, then build the application. 
        This will be due at the end of Week 6. 
        Details
        1. Description: Build a simple web app to manage a ToDo list. It should allow the creation of new tasks, 
        the viewing of tasks, a process to mark tasks as complete, ability to remove tasks, and the ability to filter by complete/not complete.
        2. Wireframes for each view.
            Todo app wireframe
        3. UI actions
            Show a list of tasks
            Add a new task
            Complete a task
            Remove a task
            Filter tasks (complete/incomplete)
        4. Data sources: localStorage
            todo: { id : timestamp, content: string, completed: bool }
            toDoList = [toDo];
        5. Initial Module list: ToDos.js, localStorage helpers (ls.js), utilities.js
        6. Colors/Typography/specific Element styling: Student to determine
        7. Schedule to provide yourself mile markers along the way to help you stay on target.
