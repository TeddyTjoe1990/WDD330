        <h2>Week 4 Notes: Forms | OOP | Modern Javascript</h2>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>For this week, I read something that i learned in the previous semester but it differs slightly in its application. This time, I read about Forms, Object Oriented Programming (OOP), and Modern Javascript
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Chapter 8: Forms</h3>
        <p>Forms have different input types
            <ul>
                <li>Input fields:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Text</li>
                    <li>Password</li>
                    <li>Checkbox</li>
                    <li>Radio</li>
                    <li>Textarea</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Buttons</li>
                <li>Hidden fields</li>
                <li>Select Drop-Down lists</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Chapter 12: Object Oriented Programming - OOP </h3>
        <p>In Object Oriented Programmming there are three main concepts. Among others: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Encapsulation - Parts of the program are inside objects and only essential functionalities are exposed to the end user. </li>
            <li> Polymorphism - The same process can be used for different objects. Various objects can be used for the same method. </li>
            <li> Inheritance - You can take an object that already exists and Inherit all its properties and methods. </li>
        </ul>

        <p> Example in real world: </p>
        <ul>
            There's a lot to a lamp but all we see is a simple switch that turns it on or off. (Encapsulation) <br/>Most, (not all) lamps can be plugged into all outlets and use any type of light bulb. (Polymorphism) <br/> Lamps are all built similarly
            but some can have differences. (Inheritance)
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The benefit of Object oriented programming is having flexible code. We can create an object and use it in other programs.
        </p>

        <h3>Chapter 12: Modular JavaScript in Modern JavaScript</h3>
        <p>A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other files and by other modules. This helps to keep code organized in separate, reusable files, which improves code maintainability. The code
            in a module should have a single purpose, and group together functions with distinct functionality.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ES6 Modules</li>
            <ul>
                <p>A ES6 module file is just a normal JavaScript file, but uses the keyword export to specify any values or functions that are to be made available from the module.</p>
            </ul>
            <li>Node.Js</li>
            <ul>
                <p>Already implemented modules before they were introduced in ES6, and used a slightly different notation called Common JS modules. At the time of writing it is proving difficult to merge the two notations in an elegant way, although it is
                    expected that Node.js will support ES6 modules in some way in the future. A Common JS module is created in a separate file, and the module.exports method is used to make any functions available to other files, in a similar way to ES6
                    modules.
                </p>
            </ul>
        </ul>
