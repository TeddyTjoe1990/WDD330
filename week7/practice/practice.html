    <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ajax is a technique for sending and receiving data asynchronously in the background.</li>
            <li>The data can be sent in many forms, but it is usually in JSON.</li>
            <li>Ajax can be used for making partial page updates without having to do a full page reload.</li>
            <li>Ajax can be used for communicating with external APIs.</li>
            <li>Ajax requests can be made using the Fetch API.</li>
            <li>The Response interface allows you to control the response received from a request or to create your own response objects.</li>
            <li>The Request interface allows you to create a request object that contains information about the request being made, such as the URL and headers.</li>
            <li>The Headers interface allows you to create HTTP headers that can be added to a request or response object.</li>
            <li>Requests can retrieve data using a GET request, or send data using a POST request.</li>
            <li>The FormData interface makes it easier to send data from forms.</li>
        </ul>
